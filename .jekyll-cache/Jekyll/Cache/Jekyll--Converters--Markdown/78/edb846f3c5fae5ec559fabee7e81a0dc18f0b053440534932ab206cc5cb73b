I"n<p>Today I’m writing about Open Redirect bypasses since it was my first bug I have found since returning. One I normally don’t bother reporting as it’s not usually very high paying and damages impacts ratings on H1. Nonetheless, Open Redirects are a nice starting point for any security researcher and it seems almost all of them require a filter bypass.</p>
